/* 

If you wish to experiment with other cost functions, (including
specific word to word cost matrices), a child class of TERcost should
be made, and an instance of it should be passed as the third arguement
to the TER function in TERcalc.

All costs must be in the range of 0.0 to 1.0.  Deviating outside of
this range may break the functionality of the TERcalc code.

This code does not do phrasal costs functions, such modification would require
changes to the TERcalc code.

In addition shifts only occur when the two subsequences are equal(),
and hash to the same location.  This can be modified from the standard
definition by using a new String data structure which redefines
those functions.
